Ticket Issue: “Email Not Working”

Hello [User],

Thank you for reaching out. I’m sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your email. I understand how frustrating that can be, especially when it impacts your daily work.

To begin resolving this, could you please confirm if you're accessing your email via the Outlook desktop app or web browser? Also, let me know if you're seeing any error messages.

In the meantime, I’ll check the mail server status and your account settings. I’ll follow up within the next 30 minutes with an update.

Thank you for your patience, and I’m here to help every step of the way.

Best regards,
